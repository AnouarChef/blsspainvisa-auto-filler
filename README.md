# blsspainvisa-auto-filler

This tampermonkey script makes it easy as a breeze to finally get an appointment for a visa to spain.

## Why this tampermonkey script?

Well, it's fairly hard to get an appointment especially because you cannot copy nor paste on the website.

## How to?

- Install the Tampermonkey browser extension
- Click on this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hExPY/blsspainvisa-auto-filler/main/blsspainvisa-auto-filler.js) to open the `blsspainvisa-auto-filler.js` file raw
- It should automatically trigger tampermonkey to install the script -> Please review the script and read the comments. Never install something from the internet without verifying!
- Replace the data from line 23 to 35 with yours. Don't forget to look up the field values for e.g. `VisaTypeId` as this might be different in your region.

## Good luck!
